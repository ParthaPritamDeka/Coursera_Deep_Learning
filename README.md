# Coursera_Deep_Learning
All Deep learning Projects under my "Coursera Deep Learning Specialization"
In this Repository I have posted all projects, I have completed under the Coursera Deep learning Specialization Such as:
- Building Deep Newural Networks using numpy, Tensorflow and then the Keras API
- Building the follwoing covnet "CONV2D -> RELU -> MAXPOOL -> CONV2D -> RELU -> MAXPOOL -> FLATTEN -> FULLYCONNECTED" for classify signs 0   to 5 
- Building a very deep convolutional networks using Residual Networks (ResNets) to  for signs 0 to 5 by solving the problem of vanishing   Gradient
- Generating new image using Neural Style using a pre-trained Convet
- Face varification and recognition:
    * Implement the triplet loss function
    * Use a pretrained model to map face images into 128-dimensional encodings
    * Use these encodings to perform face verification and face recognition
